# 🚀 LobeHub v2.1.50 (20260416)

**Release Date:** April 20, 2026\
**Migration Scope:** Agent benchmark data model bootstrap (5 new tables, 2 new indexes)

> This release introduces a schema foundation for benchmark execution and reporting, so agent evaluation data is stored as a complete lifecycle instead of fragmented records.

---

This release includes a **database schema migration** for Agent Evaluation Benchmark. We are adding **5 new tables** so benchmark setup, runs, and run-topic records can be stored in a complete and queryable structure.

## Migration overview

Previously, benchmark-related data lacked a full lifecycle model, which made it harder to track evaluation flow from dataset to run results. This migration introduces the missing relational layer so benchmark configuration, execution, and analysis records stay connected.

In practical terms, this reduces ambiguity for downstream features and gives operators a cleaner foundation for troubleshooting and reporting.

Added tables:

- `agent_eval_benchmarks`
- `agent_eval_datasets`
- `agent_eval_records`
- `agent_eval_runs`
- `agent_eval_run_topics`

## Notes for self-hosted users

- Migration runs automatically during app startup.
- No manual SQL action is required in standard deployments.
- As with any schema release, we still recommend database backup and rollout during a low-traffic window.

- `agent_eval_benchmarks`
- `agent_eval_datasets`
- `agent_eval_runs`
- `agent_eval_run_topics`
- `agent_eval_records`

Added indexes:

- `idx_agent_eval_runs_status_created_at`
- `idx_agent_eval_run_topics_run_id_topic_id`

These additions close a previous gap where benchmark data existed in partial forms but lacked a stable relational backbone for auditing and historical analysis.

## ⚙️ Operator Notes

- Migration runs automatically on application startup.
- No manual SQL is required in standard deployment paths.
- Schedule rollout in a low-traffic window and take a backup snapshot before deployment.
- If migration fails, do not retry repeatedly; inspect migration logs and lock state first.

---

## 🔒 Reliability & Risk

- Existing chat/session paths are unaffected unless benchmark features are enabled.
- Migration is additive (new tables/indexes only), minimizing downgrade risk to existing entities.
- Rollback should follow your standard DB restore or migration rollback policy if your environment requires strict reversibility.

## 👥 Owner

Migration owner: @{pr-author}

The migration owner is responsible for rollout follow-up and incident handling for this schema change.

> **Note for Claude**: Replace `{pr-author}` with the actual PR author. Retrieve via `gh pr view <number> --json author --jq '.author.login'` or from commit metadata. Do not hardcode a username.
